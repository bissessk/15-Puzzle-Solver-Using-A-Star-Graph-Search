# 15-Puzzle-Solver-Using-A-Star-Graph-Search

There are three python (`.py`) files needed to solve the Board. 

1. `Board.py`
2. `toolbox.py`
3. `learnerMain.py` (*main*)

The input files must be the correct format.

- Lines 1 to 4 contain the tile pattern for the initial state
- Lines 6 to 9 contain the tile pattern for the goal state. 
- Line 5 is a blank line. 
- Integers 1 to 15 represent tile numbers.

The 4 input files and the 3 python files must be in the same directory. The *“main”* file was named `learnerMain.py`. Open that file using an IDE that runs `Python3`.

After running the Python File, 4 output files should now appear in your directory that corresponds to the 4 Input files. These output files contain the solutions.
